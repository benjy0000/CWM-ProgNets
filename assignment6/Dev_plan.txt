Development Plan:

1) Get it so that it takes header in and returns verification
3) Get it to return something in the correct format
2) Implement adjacency matrix so that it returns something from that, use very simple graph
4) Check everything formated correctly e.g. N/A state and not connected
5) Implement shortest path algorithm.
