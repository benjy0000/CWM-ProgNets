Adjacency Matrix:

256*256 with 8 bit entries
If a road system does not fill up the 256 room, or not all nodes are connected (e.g. road ij does not exist), relevent entries are set to max time as not to interfere with path finding.

Car -> Pi Header:

1) Ethernet

2) 8 bit p
3) 8 bit four
4) 8 bit version

The above are to verify the packet is a satnav packet before parsing

5) 8 bit Location
6) 8 bit Destination
7) 8 bit Finished Road Flag
7) 16 bit Last road (zeros if N/A)
5) 8 bit last road time, once again if not applicable, set to 0

Pi -> Car Header:

1) Ethernet
2)
