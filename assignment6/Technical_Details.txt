Adjacency Matrix:

64*64 with 8 bit entries, note 0,0 is reserved for a 'not applicable' state so technicaly 63*63
as all 0 entries are ignored.
If a road system does not fill up the 63*63 room, or not all nodes are connected (e.g. road ij does not exist), relevent entries are set to max time as not to interfere with path finding.

Time Matrix:

64*64, but as the adjacency matrix reserves all 0 entries for N/A, we have to also disregard
those here. Hence 63*63

Car -> Pi Header:

1) Ethernet
2) 8 bit Location
3) 8 bit Destination
4) 48 bit (3*16) Last 3 Roads - If this is not applicable e.g. the car is just leaving home,
   then these are set to 0
5) 24 bit (3*8) Last 3 Roads Time, once again if not applicable these are set to 0

Pi -> Car Header:

1) Ethernet
